Example scripts
===============

Most of these scripts are terribly out of date and are retained in the
hope that they might be updated someday.  Currently useful scripts
are:

 - haymakers.py is an example till configuration file, adapted from
   the one in use at the Haymakers in Cambridge.

 - minimal.py is a minimal example till configuration file.

 - dbsetup.toml is a template for setting up a new till database; use it
   with the "runtill dbsetup" command.

 - quicktill.toml is a sample quicktill configuration file; copy it to
   ~/.config/quicktill.toml and edit as required.

For the web interface, see [the tillweb
project](https://github.com/sde1000/tillweb).
