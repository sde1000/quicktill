<h2>Transaction line summary</h2>

<p>This report shows transaction line descriptions in a department,
  along with the number of times they occurred within the time
  period. Voids are treated as negative occurrences, i.e. a unique
  transaction line description that is sold and then voided will show
  up with a count of zero.</p>

<p>Transaction lines that have a price of zero are not included. These
  are typically used as comments (eg. table number for food
  sales). Transaction lines that have a price but have been discounted
  to zero <em>are</em> included.</p>

<p>There are two dates associated with transaction lines, and you can
  choose either one when setting up this report:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Transaction Date: the date of the transaction in which the
    transaction line occurs.  This can change if a transaction is
    deferred from one session to the next.  Transactions that are
    currently deferred (i.e. not attached to a session) are not
    counted at all.</li>
  <li>Date entered: the date on which the transaction line was
    created.  This will not change even when the transaction is
    deferred.</li>
</ol>
